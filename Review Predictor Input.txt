1.0	Ok let me start off by saying although I'm a pregnant lady, I don't expect special treatment. However, with another human growing inside you, being hungry is serious business. After entering we were seated promptly and the waitress got our drink order right away. Unfortunately, She did not return to our table and after 15 minutes, I got up and flagged her down to take our order. Then the wait began.Seriously disappointed with the treatment.The food was preety good.Something to cheer about.
3.0	Overall really 3.5 (we need half stars!)  I've been going here for years, very since they had a place in Chandler. I think the Chandler location had better food but I head to BAG about once a year since it is not close anymore.  The food is a large step above the average mexican or southwest place. They have some very creative dishes and they all taste good.  My oly criticism is that they use too much cheese and sauce. It smothers some of the flavors they should be accentuating. If they would lighten up on these they'd gain another star.
